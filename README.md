## Overview

The **Phantom Wallet Fake Web3 Flash Balance** project showcases a method to display counterfeit crypto balances within the Phantom Wallet interface.

- **User Deception**: Create an environment where users think they hold real assets.
- **Web3 Spoofing**: Utilize Web3 technology to manipulate wallet data.
- **Phantom Wallet Integration**: Specifically designed for the Phantom Wallet interface.
